# MNIST-digits-with-keras
exploring the mnist handwritten digits dataset using keras.
this is a project i did by training on the mnist handwriten digits dataset.
the model that has been used is a simple convolutional model with just 2 convolutional blocks. 
its fascinating to see the results by training on such a small and simple model.
i was able to achieve nearly 99% accuracy on the 55,000 image train set while also getting a 98.7% accuracy on the 10,000 image test set.
